# ChristmasCountdown
**A Christmas countdown bot for Discord.** (INCOMPLETE - DAILY COUNTDOWN IS NOT FINISHED)

Daily automatic countdown to Christmas in the channel you set, and a manual `x!countdown` command.

**Live Countdown:** [countdowntoxmas.tk](https://www.countdowntoxmas.tk)

__**Commands:**__

`x!help` Command list.

`x!ping` Ping pong. Useless.


The important ones:

`x!website` Just a link to [countdowntoxmas.tk](https://www.countdowntoxmas.tk)

`x!countdown` Displays number of days left until Christmas, and a link to the live countdown.

`x!channel` Set the channel you want the automatic daily countdown to use. (required permission: `MANAGE_GUILD`)
